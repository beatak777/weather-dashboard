# Weather Dashboard 

##  <a name='Description'></a>Description
The aim of this project was to fulfil every task that needed to be done in order for the application to run smoothly. As a complete beginner in this field I am satisfied that the website is showcasing the current weather and a 5 day foreast as well. Previous searches stay on the screen and accessible for suer later on.

In addition to the design of the page I utilised bootstrap that allows the page to run on a smartphone and tablet as well without any displaying issues. I added some colours to the page to make the weather search a bit more stylish. Previous searches stay on the screen and accessible for suer later on.
